# 86ux
UNIX clone based on some older versions of Linux

86ux was officialy going to be CQX96, but CQX96 is now another project of mine.

# Building
You need CLANG 11 (or higher, but only tested with CLANG 11) and Make etc.

For the documentation you also need doxygen

# Credits
Linux -- Linus Torvalds

Linux 0.01 Compilable -- ISOUX
